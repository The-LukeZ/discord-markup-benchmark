# Project Nova: Official Documentation & Style Guide

Welcome to the official guide for **Project Nova**. This document serves as the central hub for developers, designers, and contributors. Our goal is to create a _cohesive_ and _efficient_ workflow for everyone involved. Please read this guide carefully and adhere to the standards within.

This project was formerly known as ~~Project Eclipse~~, but has been rebranded.

## Core Features

Our framework is built on three pillars: **speed**, **security**, and **scalability**.

- **Modular Architecture**: Easily add or remove components without breaking the core system.
- **Real-time API**: `WebSockets` and `Server-Sent Events` are supported out of the box.
- **Extensive Plugin System**: Customize everything with community-built or private plugins.

> Important Note: The API is stable, but plugin interfaces are subject to change before the v2.0.0 release.

### Getting Started: Installation

1.  Ensure you have `Node.js` version 18.x or higher installed.

2.  Clone the repository from our GitHub page.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/example/project-nova.git](https://github.com/example/project-nova.git)
```

3.  Navigate into the project directory and install dependencies.
    - Run the command: `npm install`
    - This will fetch all required packages.
      1. Core packages like `nova-kernel`.
      2. Development dependencies like `typescript` and `jest`.
4.  Start the development server.
    `npm run dev`

-# This is a special subtext note for developers.
-# Remember to pull the latest changes from the 'dev' branch before starting work.

## Code Style and Examples

We use a strict set of linting rules to maintain code quality. Please refer to the `.eslintrc.json` file for details.

### Basic Component Example

Here is a simple "Hello World" component written in Nova's syntax.

```
import { Component, NovaElement } from 'nova-kernel';

@Component({
  selector: 'nova-greeting',
  template: '<h1>Hello, {{ world }}!</h1>'
})
export class GreetingComponent {
  public world: string = 'World';

  constructor() {
    // Component initialization logic goes here.
    // It's really that simple!
  }
}
```
